University admission or college admission is the process through which students enter tertiary education at universities and colleges.
Systems vary widely from country to country, and sometimes from institution to institution.
In many countries, prospective university students apply for admission during their last year of high school or community college. 
In some countries, there are independent organizations or government agencies to centralize the administration of standardized admission
exams and the processing of applications.
This project provides the facility for the admin to automate admission for applied students of a college with the help of an online 
college allotment website. So we have created a website for our college and it is named as SJCET ALLOTMENT PORTAL. SJCET ALLOTMENT PORTAL
is a web site which is to be used by the admin to login and give their respective details for the admission process of  SJCET  Palai. 
It will be used to fully automate the student admission process. This website provides facility to institutes to conduct online 
admissions by providing a unique id to each student. ADMIN can login with their id to allot student to various department and to
provide automated higher option facility.
